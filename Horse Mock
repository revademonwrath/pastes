Licorice Marshmallow loudly says with a Genuan accent: You lot call that slicing?  I've seen better slicing by wet hennes at Sam Slager's, and half the times they're just taking the skin off their fingers. My Nan, May-She-Rest-In-Peace, is probably turning over in her grave right now, and it's just luck that you lot never met her.

Licorice Marshmallow loudly says with a Genuan accent: You lot call that stabbing?  You lot call that stabbing? I have a greater stabbing pain in my stomach from the cringe. You'd probably have more success if you just tried to fall over into them, but I'm afraid you might smash your face on the cobbles and I'd have to mock you about something else.
