Here's what I found so far, pretty sure bonus was slightly over 1k, like 1020 but I don't have it written down.

Enchant should have been rad.

Either way here is numbers for now:
Fine Sabre:
{-1987 HP}
{-2043 HP}
{-1970 HP}

--START SHOTO--
{-1478 HP}
{-1483 HP}
{-1512 HP}
{-1480 HP}

--START CUSTOM KATANA--
{-1932 HP}
{-1977 HP}
{-1987 HP}
{-1928 HP}

Obv shoto was regular stabs as they cannot impale
